ResNet Model Trained on CIFAR-10

Overview

This repository contains a custom ResNet model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is implemented in PyTorch and follows a residual network architecture with configurable kernel sizes and shortcut connections. CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, commonly used for image classification tasks.
